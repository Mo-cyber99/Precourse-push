# Problem Solving Katas

## 1. Errors

Understanding errors and how to approach them is a integral skill for any software developer. Errors can be quite daunting at first, but they are actually very helpful. We will look at errors and how to handle them in more detail on the bootcamp, but for now we'd like you to start familiarising yourself with them.

Below is an example of an error message from a failing test:

    getFirstItem â€º returns first item in the array

    ReferenceError: firstitem is not defined

       5 |   const firstItem = arr[0];
       6 |
    >  7 |   return firstitem;
         |   ^
       8 | }
       9 | /*
      10 |

      at getFirstItem (problem-solving/errors.js:7:3)
      at Object.<anonymous> (__tests__/errors.test.js:5:12)

The test suite is telling us here that `firstitem is not defined` and the arrows point out line 7 as the location of the problem.

We can confirm where this error is coming from through the stack trace: `at getFirstItem (problem-solving/errors.js:7:3)`.

The stack trace tells us the error is within the `getFirstItem` function inside the file `problem-solving/errors.js` on line `7`.

_NOTE: The 3 refers to which character it begins at on line 7_.

Using this information we can consider what our first steps may be in solving this error.

_NOTE: You may notice this example has been flagged as a ReferenceError. If you would like to read more about the different types of error you may encounter, [this article](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-are-the-6-types-of-errors-in-javascript-codes) has a brief overview. However we will be going into errors and types in much more detail on the bootcamp._

### TASK

In [errors.js](./errors.js) there are a number of katas designed to help you improve your understanding of errors and how to fix them.

If you run `npm test errors.test.js` you will see that all of these tests fail for various reasons.

Fix the existing code for each kata so that they pass the tests associated with them.

## 2. Refactoring

Refactoring code is not only a great chance to expand knowledge but is a way of improving and cleaning up your work. We encourage refactoring code once it's passing all the tests to see if you can elevate it. </br>
The general rule of thumb to follow is <span style="color: salmon">red</span> <span style="color: green">green</span> <span style="color: lightblue">refactor</span>. </br>

- <span style="color: salmon">Red</span> refers to tests failing. </br>
- <span style="color: green">Green</span> refers to tests passing. </br>
- <span style="color: lightblue">Refactor</span> refers to revisting the passing code and seeing if there's anything you can change.

### TASK

In [refactor-katas.js](./refactor-katas.js) we have provided you with some completed kata solutions. Your task is to refactor these solutions.

_Make sure the tests are still passing once you are finished! `npm test refactor-katas.test.js`_
