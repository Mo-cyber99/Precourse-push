    What would we want people to learn about error-spotting?
    Are there common errors we'd want them to be familiar with?
    - consts for variables we want to reassign
    - console logs that should be deleted?
    - returning the wrong data type?
    - incorrect key names with objects
    - hard coding solutions over using variables (not using params)
    - strict equality and loose equality
    - incorrect if statements
    - broken for loop (stop condition)
    - spelling mistakes
    - return in wrong place
    - wrong method on wrong data type
    - block scoping issues
