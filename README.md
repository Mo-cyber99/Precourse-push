# Precourse Section 1

Well done on passing your entry challenge and taking your first steps towards the Northcoders Bootcamp! ðŸŽ‰

While you complete your precourse we encourage you to attend our regular drop-in sessions and make use of the 'precourse' Slack channel (if you haven't received an invite let us know). PEOPLE THERE TO HELP

### The Command Line

Please read [this article](http://learntocodewith.me/getting-started/topics/command-line/) that explains why we use the command line.

Follow a tutorial on how to use the command line. There are some differences between macOS and Linux command line (Ubuntu, Mint...) so choose the appropriate one:

- [macOS](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/4614926-learn-the-command-line-in-terminal?status=published)
- [Linux/WSL](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners)

Follow the whole course up to the end. Code Academy also has [more practice material](https://codeacademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on the command line.

Print out or bookmark this [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) of common commands. The directory and file commands are most useful so try to practice with these and commit them to memory as soon as possible.

From now on, try to **always** use your terminal program (iTerm, Terminator or git bash) to navigate around your computer, make, move, copy or remove files and folders.

### Git / Github

Github is a website and cloud-based service we can use to manage our code. On our local machines, we use git version control to track changes we make.

Version control is a necessity in modern-day programming. Git and Github are big topics and we will explore them during the course in more detail, but they will be part of your daily workflow from day 1, so take some time to start learning how they work.

Make sure you have installed git (revisit the setup-guides if necessary) and that you have sent your Github account details to us on Slack.

For a basic introduction to git and Github, please watch videos 1-7 of [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV).

Try out git yourself by following the GitHub Learning Lab course [here](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

You will need to use git to download this repository so that you can work on the challenges!

### Basic Skills

You've probably already shown in your Entry Challenge that you can demonstrate the below skills, but make sure you are absolutely confident with them as they will underpin everything you do in this Precourse, in JavaScript and beyond.

- Store a value as a variable
- Execute code conditionally ('if' something is true)
- Access an item in an array if you know its index
- Access a value of an object if you know its key
- Iterate through an array or string
- Create a function with parameters that returns a value
- Execute a function with parameters
- Log values to the console



### Coding Style

It's important our code is easy to read and well laid out. As well as helping other people, it also makes our life easier when we go back and read our code over at a later date.

Read this article and implement these styling guidelines when working through the rest of the Precourse:
https://javascript.info/coding-style

Always be asking yourself 'if I was to take away the question and any comments, can someone still understand what my code is doing?'

### Challenges

### Problem Solving

Problem solving is the number one skill that employers in the tech sector value - good problem solvers are able to work in any language, technology or situation.

Please watch [these 5 videos by Michael Starbird](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT). The first two in particular really resonate with the Northcoders philosophy. Try to apply what you have learnt in these videos to the next coding problems you encounter.

If you haven't already done so, please work through some of the [Algorithm Challenges on FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting). All of the problems in this chapter are excellent practice - we recommend trying to solve 5 of them as a minimum.

### Codewars

There are lots of sites that offer katas (self-contained coding problems) for you to sharpen your problem-solving skills. One of the most important things you can do is get as much practice problem-solving with JavaScript as possible.

Create an account on [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/LwRQbA) and message us on Slack to let us know your account name so we can track your progress, if you haven't already. You should be aiming to complete level 8, 7 and 6 katas to put into practice what you are learning in the Precourse. Aim to have 200 points before starting the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp. Take the opportunity to look at other people's solutions - but remember, the shortest isn't necessarily the best. Clarity should always be your number one concern.

Here are some recommended Codewars katas to get you started.

- [Max and Min Values](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-maximum-and-minimum-values-of-a-list)
- [Miles per gallon to kilometers per liter](http://www.codewars.com/kata/miles-per-gallon-to-kilometers-per-liter)
- [Find nth Digit](http://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-nth-digit-of-a-number)
- [Are the numbers in order?](http://www.codewars.com/kata/are-the-numbers-in-order)
- [Get the Middle Character](http://www.codewars.com/kata/get-the-middle-character)
- [Removing Elements](http://www.codewars.com/kata/removing-elements)
- [Initialize my name](http://www.codewars.com/kata/initialize-my-name)
- [Needle in a Haystack](http://www.codewars.com/kata/a-needle-in-the-haystack)
- [Powers of Two](http://www.codewars.com/kata/powers-of-2)
- [Chinese Zodiac](http://www.codewars.com/kata/chinese-zodiac)
- [Leet Speak](http://www.codewars.com/kata/toleetspeak)
- [Product of largest pair](http://www.codewars.com/kata/product-of-largest-pair)
- [Palindrome strings](http://www.codewars.com/kata/palindrome-strings)

Whilst doing this, you should start to use built-in JavaScript methods. These are functions that have already been implemented for common issues in programming that you can apply to a type of value, like an array or object. If you find yourself writing code likely to be useful in a lot of situations, check if a method exists for this already. A popular place to read about built-in methods is the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) documentation.

Here are a few useful methods to get you started:

- [toUpperCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase) / [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase)
- [toString](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)
- [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split)
- [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)
- [reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse)
- [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice)
- [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf)
- [toFixed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed)
